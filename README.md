# LeetCode
<h4>Trying to land an internship? Me too.</h4>
<p> Getting an internship is difficult. I totally get the whole, "I'm trying to work on furthering my skills but it's hard while juggling school".I hope this will help you prep for your upcoming interview. I plan on adding my solutions to LeetCode questions here in the hopes that you and I can both learn.</p>
